# dotnet-mdns
An mDNS implementation for .Net Core, which supports advertising

This is *really* crude and only advertises the services for my [dotnet-homebridge](https://github.com/tomasmcguinness/dotnet-homebridge) project at this present time. Hopefully somebody might find it useful, but you're going to have to modify it heavily to make it work for you!
